// Welcome to my LinkedIn my name is Juliet Vorbe, don’t be afraid to take a look around my profile. 
// In doing so I hope you see that I am someone of many skills. Skills that can potentially be beneficial 
// to those interested in me and my services. Also I am always willing to learn new things, adopt new skills 
// and work with people. Not only that but I am not afraid to try something new or to receive feedback. 
// I am someone who can be comfortable with the uncomfortable, and letting my work speak for itself. 
// I believe working hard for me is second nature especially in my work environment, doing my job efficiently 
// and responsibly is important to me. This makes me feel good and eases my mind to know I’m doing my job effectively. 
// Especially if working with co workers, this is where communication to me becomes important to work with others successfully.
// Currently I live in New York and attending Nebula Academy taking their Software Engineering course. I look forward to find a 
// career with this new amazing skill set I am learning. Also to have a career that I enjoy while also being able to take 
// care of myself and eventually teaching others the same. This will then allow me to get back to some hobbies also which 
// involve cooking for my friends & family, doing makeup & hair, and lastly enjoying moments with loved ones.
