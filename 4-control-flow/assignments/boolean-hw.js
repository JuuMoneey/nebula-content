//1. Write a statement that checks if 2 and 'two' are equal 
let x = 2
let y = 'two'
console.log(x === y)    //false


//2. Write a statement that checks if '2' and 2 are loosely equal
let x1 = 2
let y1 = '2'
console.log(x1 != y1)   //false


//3. Write a statement that checks if 14 and '14' are strictly equal
let x2 = 14
let y2 = '14'
console.log(x2 === y2)  //false


//4. Write a statement that checks if 10 is greater than -100
let x3 = 10
let y3 = -100
console.log(x3 > y3)    //true


//5. Write a statement that checks if 4 is strictly equal to the rounded value of 4.4
let x4 = 4
let y4 = Math.round(4.4)
console.log(x4 === y4)      //true     


//6. Write a statement that checks if 10 is greater than or equal to 9.1 rounded up
let x5 = 10
let y5 = Math.ceil(9.1)
console.log(x5 >= y5)       //true


//7. Write a statement that checks if 10 is greater than 2 and 3 is greater than 4
let fig = 10
let fig1 = 2
let fig3 = 3
let fig4 = 4
console.log(fig > fig1) && (fig3 > fig4) 
// istead of && use || (or) 
// add a bang in front of second string


        //7.a Without changing any of the numbers, or their order. How do we make this print true?
        console.log(fig > fig1 && fig3 < fig4) 
    // istead of && (<- means and) use || (<- means or) 
    // add a bang in front of second string

//8. Pick a number between 1-20 and assign it to a variable
   // This is the number of watermelons you purchased.
   // If your number of watermelons is 1 or 2, console.log 'Looks like you like watermelon'
   // If your number of watermelons is more than 2, console.log 'Thats a lot of watermelon'
   // If your number of watermelons is more than 5, print, 'Thats too many watermelon!'
   // If your number of watermelons is more than 10, print, 'You must be CRAZY for watermelon!'
   // If your number of watermelons is more than 15, print, 'Did you have a coupon?'

console.log('Looks like you like watermelon')
   } else if (numOfWM > 2 && numOfWM < 5) {

   }



//9. Create a variable that represents your current hunger on a level of 1-10
 // Using a ternary, if your hunger is greater than 6 print, 'Time to eat!'
 // Otherwise print. "I'm not hungry"
 const hungerLvl = 2
 const lvl = hungerLvl > 6 ? "time to eat" : "im not hungry"
 console.log(lvl)
 // another way of writing a else if satement true or false

// 10. Think of an Magic-8 Ball
  // Write a switch statement that works the same way. 
  // When you run this file you should
  // Generate a random number
  // And get an out put from your switch statement?
  // Ex: 
    // I update a question variable to say "Will I win the lottery?"
    // I run node <FILENAME> 
    // The console prints out:
      // Will I win the lottery? Not Likely. 
      
      const randomNum = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 4) 
      const question = "Will I win the lottery??"
  
      switch(randomNum) {
        case 1:
          console.log(`${question}, Not Likely`)
          break;
        case 2:
          console.log(`${question}, IDK maybe`)
          break;
        case 3:
          console.log(`${question}, Most likely`)
          break;
        case 4:
          console.log(`${question}, For sure happening`)
          break;
      }
  
  // BONUS:
    // On the prior example, try and have the answer print like someone is speaking to you.
    
    // Ex:
      //Input:  Will I win the lottery?
      //Output: Will you win the lottery? Not likely. <- Notice I has been programmatically changed to you
  
    // Ex2:
      // Input: Will I get a new pet this year?
      // Output: Will you get a pet this year? It is certain. 
  
    // Try and handle many edge cases - can we put in any question and have it spit out a gramatically correct response?
