        <p>Hey its me Juliet here, thankyou for taking the time to grade my checkpoint.
            This bootcamp has shown me things about myself, that i've never thought to notice.
            This is just one of the reasons why i am grateful to be apart of something that is
            life changing not just financially or skills but too grow my mind and show myself
            no matter what I can do anything as long as i work for it. Thankyou nebula academy. </p>
