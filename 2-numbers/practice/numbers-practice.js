// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
let figure9 = 9
let answer1 = 9 * 2


// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
let figure6= 6
let figure2 = 2
const answer2 = figure1 + figure2


// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
let figure1 = 100
let figure25 = 25
let figure50 = 50

const answer = (figure1 - (figure50 + figure25))
console.log(answer)

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other



// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
let figure3 = 3
let figure7 = 7
const answer3 = figure3 * figure7
console.log(answer3)


// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, t the console 



// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
